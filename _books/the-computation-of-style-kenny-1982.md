Each year more and more scholars are becoming aware of the importance of the statistical study of literary texts. The present book is the first elementary introduction in English for those wishing to use statistical techniques in the study of literature. Unlike other introductions to statistics, it specifically emphasizes those techniques most useful in literary contexts and gives examples of their application from literary and linguistic material. The text is aimed at those with the minimum of mathematical background and gives exercises for the student and relevant statistical tables.
