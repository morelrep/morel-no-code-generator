With word processing and the Internet, computing is much more part and parcel of the everyday life of the humanities scholar, but computers can do much more than assist with writing or Internet searching. This book introduces a range of tools and techniques for manipulating and analysing electronic texts in the humanities. It shows how electronic texts can be used for the literary analysis, linguistic analysis, authorship attribution, and the preparation and publication of electronic scholarly editions. It assesses the ways in which research in corpus and computational linguistics can feed into better electronic tools for humanities research. The tools and techniques discussed in this book will feed into better Internet tools and pave the way for the electronic scholar of the twenty-first century.
