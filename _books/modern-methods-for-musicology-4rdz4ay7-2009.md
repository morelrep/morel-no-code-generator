Written by leading experts, this volume provides a picture of the realities of current ICT use in musicology as well as prospects and proposals for how it could be fruitfully used in the future. Through its coverage of topics spanning content-based sound searching/retrieval, sound and content analysis, markup and text encoding, audio resource sharing, and music recognition, this book highlights the breadth and inter-disciplinary nature of the subject matter and provides a valuable resource to technologists, musicologists, musicians and music educators. It facilitates the identification of worthwhile goals to be achieved using technology and effective interdisciplinary collaboration.
