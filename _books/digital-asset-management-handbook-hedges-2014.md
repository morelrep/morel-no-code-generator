Digital Asset Management in Theory and Practice includes an evolving case study that serves to illustrate the topics and issues addressed in each chapter, as well as a sequence of practical exercises using freely available DAM software. Readership: Information professionals who work (or aim to work) in the digital content industries and managers of digital assets of various forms. Cultural and memory institutions, digital archives, and any areas of science, government and business organisation where there is a need to curate digital assets.
