This is a no-code sample of a site built with MOREL. MOREL generates web sites from bibliographic collections. The MOREL sites gather book covers, excerpts, bibliographic clues, metadata and digital downloads from items stored in the Zotero reference manager.

Works are organized by dynamic lists, which automatically group the works according to common characteristics:

- [authors]({{site.BASE_PATH}}/chriteria/author)
- [city of publication]({{site.BASE_PATH}}/chriteria/city)
- [imprint or publisher]({{site.BASE_PATH}}/chriteria/publisher)
- [nationality of authors]({{site.BASE_PATH}}/chriteria/nationality)
- [edition date]({{site.BASE_PATH}}/chriteria/edition)
- [digital repository]({{site.BASE_PATH}}/criteria/repository).

MOREL also has a [search engine]({{site.BASE_PATH}}/search) that allows you to find works directly.
