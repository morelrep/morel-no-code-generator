Drawing on bibliographical information on the Australian novel in the AustLit database, the book addresses debates and issues in literary studies through a method that combines book history’s pragmatic approach to literary data with the digital humanities’ idea of computer modelling as an experimental and iterative practice. As well as showcasing this method, the case studies in ‘Reading by Numbers’ provide a revised history of the Australian novel, focusing on the nineteenth century and the decades since the end of the Second World War, and engaging with a range of themes including literary and cultural value, authorship, gender, genre and the transnational circulation of fiction. The book’s findings challenge established arguments in Australian literary studies, book history, feminism and gender studies, while presenting innovative ways of understanding literature, publishing, authorship and reading, and the relationships between them. More broadly, by demonstrating critical ways in which the growing number of digital archives in the humanities can be mined, modelled and visualised, ‘Reading by Numbers’ offers new directions and scope for digital humanities research.",2012,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,,,,,,Reading by numbers,,,,,Anthem Press,New York,en,,,,,,,,"'Reading by Numbers: Recalibrating the Literary Field' is the first book to use digital humanities strategies to integrate the scope and methods of book and publishing history with issues and debates in literary studies.

In fact, as other digital humanities scholarship demonstrates, the humanities as a boundary is itself suspect: it is not uncommon to see collaborations between a literary scholar, a computer scientist, and a librarian in digital humanities work. The artificial distinctions that have replicated the discipline divisions have become less relevant to those working in digital humanities, who often group around subject matter, not training. Add to this the increasing breakdown of national boundaries in literary studies, and perhaps it seems antiquated or anathema to reproduce American as a term with which to saddle a supposedly cutting-edge collection of essays.",2011,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,,,,"""By casting the collection explicitly as an outreach to the larger community of Americanists---not primarily those who self-identify as 'digital scholars'---Earhart and Jewell have made an important choice, and one that will likely make this a landmark publication."" ---Andrew Stauffer, University of Virginia The American Literature Scholar in the Digital Age, which features a wide range of practitioner-scholars, is the first of its kind: a gathering of people who are expert in American literary studies and in digital technologies, scholars uniquely able to draw from experience with building digital resources and to provide theoretical commentary on how the transformation to new technologies alters the way we think about and articulate scholarship in American literature. The volume collects articles from those who are involved in tool development, usability testing, editing and textual scholarship, digital librarianship, and issues of race and ethnicity in digital humanities, while also situating digital humanities work within the larger literary discipline. In addition, the volume examines the traditional structures of the fields, including tenure and promotion criteria, modes of scholarly production, the skill sets required for scholarship, and the training of new scholars. The American Literature Scholar in the Digital Age will attract practitioners of digital humanities in multiple fields, Americanists who utilize digital materials, and those who are intellectually curious about the new movement and materials.

New technology is changing the very nature of research and teaching in the social sciences and humanities. From specialized online forums to Web-based teaching and distance learning, computers are being used to expand educational opportunities, promote cooperation and collaboration, stimulate creative thinking, and find answers to previously insoluble research problems. Combining interactive projects in a CD-ROM format with informative printed essays, this volume showcases innovations that are revolutionizing the craft of scholarship. More than that, it examines realistically how applicable the new technology is to learning. Contributors clarify some of the difficulties of using computers and address problems with the philosophy and culture of computers, including concerns about intellectual property protection and the potential for creating a technological underclass of electronically disadvantaged schools and universities. The accompanying CD features multimedia entries such as an interactive project on owls that educates users about forest ecology; RiverWeb, an interactive archive of information on the history, culture, and science of the Mississippi River; and ""Global Jukebox,"" which recreates the context in which the folklorist Alan Lomax made his pioneering field recordings.

The long history of textual editing and scholarship has been intimately involved with the physique of the book, which set limits on the presentation and study of text. Increasingly, since the 1980s, the written word has taken on a digital form, and the shift from codex to computer, from print to electronic media, creates new opportunities--and new difficulties. This volume offers an emerging consensus about the fundamental issues of electronic textual editing. It provides practical advice and faces theoretical questions. Its twenty-four essays deal with markup coding and procedures, electronic archive administration, use of standards (such as Unicode), rights and permissions, and the changing and challenging environment of the Internet. Some of the specific texts discussed are Greek and Latin inscriptions, the Gospel of John, the Canterbury Tales, William Blake's poems and art, Percy Bysshe Shelley's The Devil's Walk, Stijn Streuvels's De teleurgang van den Waterhoek, Ludwig Wittgenstein's Nachlass, and the papers of Thomas Edison.

There are already historical studies of musicology, logic, art history, linguistics, and historiography, but this volume gathers these, and many other humanities disciplines, into a single coherent account. Its central theme is the way in which scholars throughout the ages and in virtually all civilizations have sought to identify patterns in texts, art, music, languages, literature, and the past. What rules can we apply if we wish to determine whether a tale about the past is trustworthy? By what criteria are we to distinguish consonant from dissonant musical intervals? What rules jointly describe all possible grammatical sentences in a language? How can modern digital methods enhance pattern-seeking in the humanities? Rens Bod contends that the hallowed opposition between the sciences (mathematical, experimental, dominated by universal laws) and the humanities (allegedly concerned with unique events and hermeneutic methods) is a mistake born of a myopic failure to appreciate the pattern-seeking that lies at the heart of this inquiry. A New History of the Humanities amounts to a persuasive plea to give Panini, Valla, Bopp, and countless other often overlooked intellectual giants their rightful place next to the likes of Galileo, Newton, and Einstein.",2013,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,,,,,,A new history of the humanities,,,,,Oxford Univ.

In some cases their analysis confirms the current scholarly consensus, bringing long-standing questions to something like a final resolution. In other areas the book provides more surprising conclusions: that Shakespeare wrote the 1602 additions to The Spanish Tragedy, for example, and that Marlowe along with Shakespeare was a collaborator on Henry VI, Parts 1 and 2.

TA84TUAS,book,2010,"Harley, Diane; Acord, Sophia Krzys; Earl-Novell, Sarah; Lawrence, Shannon; King, C. Judson",Assessing the Future Landscape of Scholarly Communication: An Exploration of Faculty Values and Needs in Seven Disciplines,,,,,http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/15x7385g,"Since 2005, the Center for Studies in Higher Education (CSHE), with generous funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, has been conducting research to understand the needs and practices of faculty for in-progress scholarly communication (i.e., forms of communication employed as research is being executed) as well as archival publication. This report brings together the responses of 160 interviewees across 45, mostly elite, research institutions in seven selected academic fields: archaeology, astrophysics, biology, economics, history, music, and political science. The overview document summarizes the main practices we explored across all seven disciplines: tenure and promotion, dissemination, sharing, collaboration, resource creation and consumption, and public engagement. We published the report online in such a way that readers can search various topics within and across case studies.∗ Our premise has always been that disciplinary conventions matter and that social realities (and individual personality) will dictate how new practices, including those under the rubric of Web 2.0 or cyberinfrastructure, are adopted by scholars. That is, the academic values embodied in disciplinary cultures, as well as the interests of individual players, have to be considered when envisioning new schemata for the communication of scholarship at its various stages. We identified five key topics, addressed in detail in the case studies, that require real attention: (1) The development of more nuanced tenure and promotion practices that do not rely exclusively on the imprimatur of the publication or easily gamed citation metrics, (2) A reexamination of the locus, mechanisms, timing, and meaning of peer review, (3) Competitive, high-quality, and affordable journals and monograph publishing platforms (with strong editorial boards, peer review, and sustainable business models), (4) New models of publication that can accommodate arguments of varied length, rich media, and embedded links to data; plus institutional assistance to manage permissions of copyrighted material, and (5) Support for managing and preserving new research methods and products, including components of natural language processing, visualization, complex distributed databases, and GIS, among many others. Although robust infrastructures are needed locally and beyond, the sheer diversity of scholars’ needs across the disciplines and the rapid evolution of the technologies themselves means that one-size-fits-all solutions will almost always fall short. As faculty continue to innovate and pursue new avenues in their research, both the technical and human infrastructure will have to evolve with the ever-shifting needs of scholars. This infrastructure will, by necessity, be built within the context of disciplinary conventions, reward systems, and the practice of peer review, all of which undergird the growth and evolution of superlative academic endeavors.",2010,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,,,,,,,,,,,"CSHE, UC Berkeley",Berkeley,en,,,,,,,,"<div class=""comment"">

Katherine Hayles poses this question at the beginning of this bracing exploration of the idea that we think through, with, and alongside media. As the age of print passes and new technologies appear every day, this proposition has become far more complicated, particularly for the traditionally print-based disciplines in the humanities and qualitative social sciences. With a rift growing between digital scholarship and its print-based counterpart, Hayles argues for contemporary technogenesis-the belief that humans and technics are coevolving-and advocates for what she calls comparative media studies, a new approach to locating digital work within print traditions and vice versa. Hayles examines the evolution of the field from the traditional humanities and how the digital humanities are changing academic scholarship, research, teaching, and publication. She goes on to depict the neurological consequences of working in digital media, where skimming and scanning, or ""hyper reading,"" and analysis through machine algorithms are forms of reading as valid as close reading once was. Hayles contends that we must recognize all three types of reading and understand the limitations and possibilities of each. In addition to illustrating what a comparative media perspective entails, Hayles explores the technogenesis spiral in its full complexity. She considers the effects of early databases such as telegraph code books and confronts our changing perceptions of time and space in the digital age, illustrating this through three innovative digital productions-Steve Tomasula's electronic novel, T.O.C.; Steven Hall's The Raw Shark Texts; and Mark Z. Danielewski's Only Revolutions. Deepening our understanding of the extraordinary transformative powers digital technologies have placed in the hands of humanists, How We Think presents a cogent rationale for tackling the challenges facing the humanities today.",2012,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,,,,,,How we think,,,,,The University of Chicago Press,Chicago; London,en,,,,,,,,"How we think: digital media and contemporary technogenesis -- First interlude: practices and processes in digital media -- The digital humanities: engaging the issues -- How we read: close, hyper, machine -- Second interlude: the complexities of contemporary technogenesis -- Tech-toc: complex temporalities and contemporary technogenesis -- Technogenesis in action: telegraph code books and the place of the human -- Third interlude: narrative and database: digital media as forms -- Narrative and database: spatial history and the limits of symbiosis -- Transcendent data and transmedia narrative: Steven Hall's The raw shark texts -- Mapping time, charting data: the spatial aesthetic of Mark Z.

Pieces in the book explore how DH can and must change in response to social justice movements and events like #Ferguson; how DH alters and is altered by community college classrooms; and how scholars applying DH approaches to feminist studies, queer studies, and black studies might reframe the commitments of DH analysts. Numerous contributors examine the movement of interdisciplinary DH work into areas such as history, art history, and archaeology, and a special forum on large-scale text mining brings together position statements on a fast-growing area of DH research. In the multivalent aspects of its arguments, progressing across a range of platforms and environments, Debates in the Digital Humanities 2016 offers a vision of DH as an expanded field—new possibilities, differently structured. Published simultaneously in print, e-book, and interactive webtext formats, each DH annual will be a book-length publication highlighting the particular debates that have shaped the discipline in a given year. By identifying key issues as they unfold, and by providing a hybrid model of open-access publication, these volumes and the Debates in the Digital Humanities series will articulate the present contours of the field and help forge its future.

HIGPF7BM,book,2010,"Forte, Maurizio",Cyber-Archaeology,,978-1-4073-0721-3,,,,"The ontology of archaeological information, or the cybernetics of archaeology, refers to all the interconnective relationships which the datum produces, the code of transmission, and its transmittability. Because it depends on interrelationships, by its very nature information cannot be neutral with respect to how it is processed and perceived. It follows that the process of knowledge and communication have to be unified and represented by a single vector. 3D information is regarded as the core of the knowledge process, because it creates feedback, then cybernetic difference, among the interactor, the scientist and the ecosystem. It is argued that Virtual Reality (both offline and online) represents a possible ecosystem, which is able to host top-down and bottom-up processes of knowledge and communication. In these terms, the past is generated and coded by “a simulation process”. Thus, from the first phases of data acquisition in the field, the technical methodologies and technologies that we use, influence in a decisive way all the subsequent phases of interpretation and communication. Thus, the questions which we pose in a phase of bottom-up knowledge (for example, in an archaeological excavation) will influence the top-down phases of interpretation, or the mental patterns (for example, a comparative analysis and reconstruction of models). If we peremptorily separate knowledge and communication, we risk losing information along the way, reducing the relationships that are constructed between acquisition/input and transmission/output. At the University of California, Merced, we are experimenting different forms of virtual embodiment and participatory learning. The innovation factor is mainly based on the principle of “enaction”: A principle employed by avatar-driven virtual (embodied) communities for perceiving and constructing information. This neuro-phenomenologic approach is based on the assumption that the cognitive activity is “embodied”, i. e. not separated from the body perception. In these terms it can be correctly identified and communicated only within its specific context. It seems evident that embodiment depends on the level of immersion in the cyberspace: if well implemented embodied communities should be able to learn and transmit more knowledge and in a shorter time than traditional text-based “chatting” communities. We distinguish different types of embodiment (A-B-C) according to levels and modalities of participatory learning and capacities of interaction; each embodiment level will focus on a different kind of interactive learning interface, content target and group of users. Embodiment A: Virtual Participatory Museum. In this case the VR system is planned for interactive platforms (each one with a mono display) and a large HD stereo display serving for group display. The users/players interact in a common 3D space, the rest of the audience can watch by stereo vision. In this way it is possible to obtain a double participation: one active, between the user/players and one passive between a larger audience watching the environment in the large 3D screen. Target users are museum visitors. Embodiment B: Simulation Participatory Environment. (Powerwall, http:// graphics.ucmerced.edu/ research.html). The primary purpose of this environment is to visualize datasets in a large and interactive high resolution display capable of achieving a very high degree of 3D immersion. Within the Powerwall environment it will be possible to integrate full-body 3D motion capture devices in order to implement novel interaction interfaces between immersed users, the environment, and avatars or autonomous characters simulated in the virtual environment. This environment will enable the team to develop new humanlike motion interfaces for collaborative virtual environments, in particular for achieving seamless human-computer interactions accessible to non computer experts for programming motions in the virtual environments. This will allow archeologists to precisely program the correct motions associated with the environment and will enable a novel concept of “Motion Heritage”. Target users are: archaeologists and scientific community.",2010,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,153,,,,,,,,,,Archaeopress,"Oxford, England",en,,,,,,,,"<div class=""comment"">

Planned Obsolescence is both a provocation to think more broadly about the academy’s future and an argument for reconceiving that future in more communally-oriented ways. Facing these issues head-on, Kathleen Fitzpatrick focuses on the technological changes—especially greater utilization of internet publication technologies, including digital archives, social networking tools, and multimedia—necessary to allow academic publishing to thrive into the future. But she goes further, insisting that the key issues that must be addressed are social and institutional in origin.  Springing from original research as well as Fitzpatrick’s own hands-on experiments in new modes of scholarly communication through MediaCommons, the digital scholarly network she co-founded, Planned Obsolescence explores these aspects of scholarly work, as well as issues surrounding the preservation of digital scholarship and the place of publishing within the structure of the contemporary university.

How does digitisation shape scholarly identity? How do we negotiate trust in the digital realm? What is scholarship, what forms can it take, and how does it acquire authority? This diverse set of essays demonstrate the importance of asking such questions, bringing together established and emerging scholars from a variety of disciplines, at a time when data is increasingly being incorporated as an input and output in humanities sources and publications. Major themes addressed include the changing nature of scholarly publishing in a digital age, the different kinds of ‘gate-keepers’ for scholarship, and the difficulties of effectively assessing the impact of digital resources. The essays bring theoretical and practical perspectives into conversation, offering readers not only comprehensive examinations of past and present discourse on digital scholarship, but tightly-focused case studies. This timely volume illuminates the different forces underlying the shifting practices in humanities research today, with especial focus on how humanists take ownership of, and are empowered by, technology in unexpected ways.

The 'Digital Economy' is an important component of institutional planning, and much attention is given to the investment in digital projects and programmes. However, few initiatives have examined the actual use, value and impact of digital collections, and the role of digital collections in the changing information environment. As the creative, cultural and educational sector faces a period of restricted funding, it is timely to re-examine the use of the digital collections that have been created in the past twenty years, and to consider their value to the institutions that host them and to the communities of users they serve. This book brings together a group of international experts to consider the following key issues: What is the role of digital resources in the research life cycle? Do the arts and humanities face a 'data deluge'? How are digital collections to be sustained over the long term? How is use and impact to be assessed? What is the role of digital collections in the 'digital economy'? How is public engagement with digital cultural heritage materials to be assessed and supported? This book will be of interest to academics, librarians, archivists and the staff of cultural heritage organizations, as well as funders and other key stakeholders with an interest in the development and long term sustainability of digital collections.""--Publisher's website.

Acces: la generalisation de l'offre rendue possible par la numerisation et la mise en reseau sur le web se heurte aux questions de propriete. a qui doit appartenir le patrimoine numerise: aux etats ou aux entreprises qui investissent parfois a echelle industrielle ? Comment concilier le droit d'auteur avec la logique de diffusion dans l'interet general ? Quelles sont les caracteristiques de cette nouvelle forme d'economie culturelle ? Mediations: comment, a la faveur de la numerisation du patrimoine, le regard que nous portons sur les oeuvres est-il construit ? Que devient la notion de collection ? Quels sont les dispositifs d'accompagnement ou de participation ? Quelles sont les nouvelles pratiques professionnelles induites par la numerisation du patrimoine ? Cultures numeriques: comment caracteriser les cultures informationnelles (information litteracy), les competences qu'elles necessitent en matiere de lecture et de recherche d'information, les normes et les filtres qui sont mis en place ?

Although advances in data mining technology have made extensive data collection much easier, it's still always evolving and there is a constant need for new techniques and tools that can help us transform this data into useful information and knowledge. Since the previous edition's publication, great advances have been made in the field of data mining. Not only does the third of edition of Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques continue the tradition of equipping you with an understanding and application of the theory and practice of discovering patterns hidden in large data sets, it also focuses on new, important topics in the field: data warehouses and data cube technology, mining stream, mining social networks, and mining spatial, multimedia and other complex data. Each chapter is a stand-alone guide to a critical topic, presenting proven algorithms and sound implementations ready to be used directly or with strategic modification against live data. This is the resource you need if you want to apply today's most powerful data mining techniques to meet real business challenges. * Presents dozens of algorithms and implementation examples, all in pseudo-code and suitable for use in real-world, large-scale data mining projects. * Addresses advanced topics such as mining object-relational databases, spatial databases, multimedia databases, time-series databases, text databases, the World Wide Web, and applications in several fields. *Provides a comprehensive, practical look at the concepts and techniques you need to get the most out of your data",2011,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,703,,,,,Data mining,,,,,Elsevier,"Burlington, MA",,,,,,,,,"Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques provides the concepts and techniques in processing gathered data or information, which will be used in various applications.

Illuminating the kind of future such experiments could enable, SpecLab functions as more than a set of case studies at the intersection of computers and humanistic inquiry. It also exemplifies Drucker’s contention that humanists must play a role in designing models of knowledge for the digital age—models that will determine how our culture will function in years to come.

Making use of corpus- and computerlinguistic methods and statistical procedures, the study shows that intuitive stylistic findings can in many cases be corroborated by empirical data. Ideally, the intuitive and the empirical approaches to style should be understood as complementing each other rather than as mutually exclusive concepts. The notion of style that emerges from this study is that of a number of basic decisions made by the author of a text, from which the remaining discriminatory linguistic characteristics of that text, choices, are derived.",1999,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,426,,352.0,,,,Europäische Hochschulschriften,14,,,Lang,Frankfurt am Main [u.a.],en,,,,,,,"Augsburg, Univ., Diss., 1998",,,,,act_StylisticAnalysis; AnalyzeStatistically; t_Stylometry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ZBQZ4VF2,book,2009,"Gries, Stefan Thomas",Statistics for linguistics with R: a practical introduction / by Stefan Th. Gries,,978-3-11-020564-0,,,http://www.degruyter.com/view/product/203826,"his book is the revised and extended second edition of Statistics for Linguistics with R. The volume is an introduction to statistics for linguists using the open source software R. It is aimed at students and instructors/professors with little or no statistical background and is written in a non-technical and reader-friendly/accessible style. It first introduces in detail the overall logic underlying quantitative studies: exploration, hypothesis formulation and operationalization, and the notion and meaning of significance tests. It then introduces some basics of the software R relevant to statistical data analysis. A chapter on descriptive statistics explains how summary statistics for frequencies, averages, and correlations are generated with R and how they are graphically represented best. A chapter on analytical statistics explains how statistical tests are performed in R on the basis of many different linguistic case studies: For nearly every single example, it is explained what the structure of the test looks like, how hypotheses are formulated, explored, and tested for statistical significance, how the results are graphically represented, and how one would summarize them in a paper/article. A chapter on selected multifactorial methods introduces how more complex research designs can be studied: methods for the study of multifactorial frequency data, correlations, tests for means, and binary response data are discussed and exemplified step-by-step. Also, the exploratory approach of hierarchical cluster analysis is illustrated in detail. The book comes with many exercises, boxes with short think breaks and warnings, recommendations for further study, and answer keys as well as a statistics for linguists newsgroup on the companion website. Just like the first edition, it is aimed at students, faculty, and researchers with little or no statistical background in statistics or the open source programming language R. It avoids mathematical jargon and discusses the logic and structure of quantitative studies and introduces descriptive statistics as well as a range of monofactorial statistical tests for frequencies, distributions, means, dispersions, and correlations. The comprehensive revision includes new small sections on programming topics that facilitate statistical analysis, the addition of a variety of statistical functions readers can apply to their own data, a revision of overview sections on statistical tests and regression modeling, a complete rewrite of the chapter on multifactorial approaches, which now contains sections on linear regression, binary and ordinal logistic regression, multinomial and Poisson regression, and repeated-measures ANOVA, and a new visual tool to identify the right statistical test for a given problem and data set. The amount of code available from the companion website has doubled in size, providing much supplementary material on statistical tests and advanced plotting.",2009,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,,,,,,Statistics for linguistics with R,,,,,Mouton de Gruyter,Berlin,en,,,,,,,,"The book features recommendations for further study, think breaks and exercises.

And as archaeologists accustomed to dealing with ""deep time,"" how can we best understand the possibilities and limitations of the Web in meeting the specialized needs of professionals in this field? These are among the many questions posed and addressed in Archaeology 2.0: New Approaches to Communication and Collaboration, edited by Eric Kansa, Sarah Whitcher Kansa, and Ethan Watrall. With contributions from a range of experts in archaeology and technology, this volume is organized around four key topics that illuminate how the revolution in communications technology reverberates across the discipline: approaches to information retrieval and information access; practical and theoretical concerns inherent in design choices for archaeology's computing infrastructure; collaboration through the development of new technologies that connect field-based researchers and specialists within an international archaeological community and scholarly communications issues, with an emphasis on concerns over sustainability and preservation imperatives. This book not only describes practices that attempt to mitigate some of the problems associated with the Web, such as information overload and disinformation, it also presents compelling case studies of actual digital projects--many of which are rich in structured data and multimedia content or focused on generating content from the field ""in real time,"" and all of which demonstrate how the Web can and is being used to transform archaeological communications into forms that are more open, inclusive, and participatory. Above all, this volume aims to share these experiences to provide useful guidance for other researchers interested in applying technology to archaeology.

Yet the use of these tools is limited—many historians and history educators have resisted adopting them because they fail to see how digital tools supplement and even improve upon conventional tools (such as books). In Pastplay, a collection of essays by leading history and humanities researchers and teachers, editor Kevin Kee works to address these concerns head-on. How should we use technology? Playfully, Kee contends. Why? Because doing so helps us think about the past in new ways; through the act of creating technologies, our understanding of the past is re-imagined and developed. From the insights of numerous scholars and teachers, Pastplay argues that we should play with technology in history because doing so enables us to see the past in new ways by helping us understand how history is created; honoring the roots of research, teaching, and technology development; requiring us to model our thoughts; and then allowing us to build our own understanding.",2014,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,,,,,,,Digital Culture,,,,Univ. of Michigan Press,Ann Arbor,en,,,,,,,,"A collection of scholars and teachers of history unpack how computing technologies are transforming the ways that we learn, communicate, and teach.

Lawrence Lessig could be called a cultural environmentalist. One of America's most original and influential public intellectuals, his focus is the social dimension of creativity: how creative work builds on the past and how society encourages or inhibits that building with laws and technologies. In his two previous books, Code and The Future of Ideas, Lessig concentrated on the destruction of much of the original promise of the Internet. Now, in Free Culture, he widens his focus to consider the diminishment of the larger public domain of ideas. In this powerful wake-up call he shows how short-sighted interests blind to the long-term damage they're inflicting are poisoning the ecosystem that fosters innovation. All creative works-books, movies, records, software, and so on-are a compromise between what can be imagined and what is possible-technologically and legally. For more than two hundred years, laws in America have sought a balance between rewarding creativity and allowing the borrowing from which new creativity springs. The original term of copyright set by the Constitution in 1787 was seventeen years. Now it is closer to two hundred. Thomas Jefferson considered protecting the public against overly long monopolies on creative works an essential government role. What did he know that we've forgotten? Lawrence Lessig shows us that while new technologies always lead to new laws, never before have the big cultural monopolists used the fear created by new technologies, specifically the Internet, to shrink the public domain of ideas, even as the same corporations use the same technologies to control more and more what we can and can't do with culture. As more and more culture becomes digitized, more and more becomes controllable, even as laws are being toughened at the behest of the big media groups. What's at stake is our freedom-freedom to create, freedom to build, and ultimately, freedom to imagine.

PZUQWSVH,book,2005,"Moretti, Franco","Graphs, maps, trees: abstract models for a literary history",,978-1-84467-026-0,,,,"Professor Franco Moretti argues heretically that literature scholars should stop reading books and start counting, graphing, and mapping them instead. He insists that such a move could bring new luster to a tired field, one that in some respects is among ""the most backwards disciplines in the academy."" Literary study, he argues, has been random and unsystematic. For any given period scholars focus on a select group of a mere few hundred texts: the canon. As a result, they have allowed a narrow distorting slice of history to pass for the total picture.Moretti offers bar charts, maps, and time lines instead, developing the idea of ""distant reading,"" set forth in his path-breaking essay ""Conjectures on World Literature,"" into a full-blown experiment in literary historiography, where the canon disappears into the larger literary system.

Como si de un antídoto se tratara, este ensayo pretende aportar algunas respuestas sobre la naturaleza de los cambios y pequeñas revoluciones que hemos llegado ya a asumir, al tiempo que desea plantear nuevos interrogantes sobre los caminos que debemos seguir en el futuro si queremos sacarle el máximo rendimiento al texto digital, a la revolución del conocimiento que está llamando a nuestras puertas. Nos guste o no, tenemos que asumir que nuestros hábitos de creación, acceso y consumo cultural están experimentando una transformación histórica con la llegada de Internet. Ante estas nuevas formas de crear, acceder y consumir la cultura, autores, editores, libreros y bibliotecarios, entre otros, deberán reflexionar sobre cuál será su nuevo papel. Nadie tiene hoy en día una hoja de ruta con un esquema claro sobre cuál es el futuro de la sociedad digital. Y aunque el libro de José Manuel Lucía Megías deja de manera intencionada muchos interrogantes sin respuesta, su lectura ayuda a reflexionar, a despejar falsos miedos y a asumir una mentalidad de innovación para romper esquemas con el fin de descifrar el nuevo paradigma.

Along the way, you'll experiment with concepts through hands-on workshops at the end of each chapter.

And as archaeologists accustomed to dealing with ""deep time,"" how can we best understand the possibilities and limitations of the Web in meeting the specialized needs of professionals in this field? These are among the many questions posed and addressed in Archaeology 2.0: New Approaches to Communication and Collaboration, edited by Eric Kansa, Sarah Whitcher Kansa, and Ethan Watrall. With contributions from a range of experts in archaeology and technology, this volume is organized around four key topics that illuminate how the revolution in communications technology reverberates across the discipline: approaches to information retrieval and information access; practical and theoretical concerns inherent in design choices for archaeology's computing infrastructure; collaboration through the development of new technologies that connect field-based researchers and specialists within an international archaeological community and scholarly communications issues, with an emphasis on concerns over sustainability and preservation imperatives. This book not only describes practices that attempt to mitigate some of the problems associated with the Web, such as information overload and disinformation, it also presents compelling case studies of actual digital projects--many of which are rich in structured data and multimedia content or focused on generating content from the field ""in real time,"" and all of which demonstrate how the Web can and is being used to transform archaeological communications into forms that are more open, inclusive, and participatory. Above all, this volume aims to share these experiences to provide useful guidance for other researchers interested in applying technology to archaeology.

The key to answering these questions, and many more, is big data. “Big data” refers to our burgeoning ability to crunch vast collections of information, analyze it instantly, and draw sometimes profoundly surprising conclusions from it. This emerging science can translate myriad phenomena—from the price of airline tickets to the text of millions of books—into searchable form, and uses our increasing computing power to unearth epiphanies that we never could have seen before. A revolution on par with the Internet or perhaps even the printing press, big data will change the way we think about business, health, politics, education, and innovation in the years to come. It also poses fresh threats, from the inevitable end of privacy as we know it to the prospect of being penalized for things we haven’t even done yet, based on big data’s ability to predict our future behavior. In this brilliantly clear, often surprising work, two leading experts explain what big data is, how it will change our lives, and what we can do to protect ourselves from its hazards. Big Data is the first big book about the next big thing. www.big-data-book.com",2013,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,242,,,,,Big data,,,,,Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,Boston,en,,,,,,,,"A exploration of the latest trend in technology and the impact it will have on the economy, science, and society at large.

By doing this they are in many ways creating the syntax of a new language. This book can be seen as the first dictionary of this new lexicon. In Visual Complexity: Mapping Patterns of Information, Manuel Lima collects and presents almost three hundred of the most compelling examples of information design — everything from representing networks of followers on Twitter and the eighty-five recorded covers of Joy Division’s “Love Will Tear Us Apart” to depicting interconnections between members of the Al Queda network and interactions among proteins in a human cell.

His elegant readings reveal that the most striking similarities between these two lie not in their nationality or style but in their shared fascination with the process of revision. Van Hulle's thoughtful application of genetic theory--the study of a work from manuscript to final form in its various iterations--marks a new phase in this dynamic field of inquiry. As one of only a handful of books in English dealing with this emerging area of study, Manuscript Genetics, Joyce's Know-How, Beckett's Nohow will be indispensable not only to Joyce and Beckett scholars but also to anyone interested in genetic criticism.

The BDMP (www.beckettarchive.org) digitally reunites the dispersed manuscripts of Samuel Beckett's works and facilitates their examination. The project consists of two parts: a digital archive of Beckett's a manuscripts, with facsimiles and transcriptions, organized in modules; b a series of print volumes, analyzing the genesis of Beckett's works. This first volume of the BDMP studies Beckett's last works: ""Stirrings still / Soubresauts and Comment dire/what is the word"". It examines the notes, manuscripts, typescripts and other writing traces and reconstructs the dynamics of the composition process on the basis of this material.

Most records today are born digital, and libraries and other collecting institutions increasingly receive computer storage media as part of their acquisition of ""papers"" from writers, scholars, scientists, musicians, and public figures. This poses new challenges to librarians, archivists, and curators—challenges related to accessing and preserving legacy formats, recovering data, ensuring authenticity, and maintaining trust. The methods and tools developed by forensics experts represent a novel approach to these demands. For example, the same forensics software that indexes a criminal suspect's hard drive allows the archivist to prepare a comprehensive manifest of the electronic files a donor has turned over for accession. This report introduces the field of digital forensics in the cultural heritage sector and explores some points of convergence between the interests of those charged with collecting and maintaining born-digital cultural heritage materials and those charged with collecting and maintaining legal evidence.",2010,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,,,,,,,,,,,Council on Library and Information Resources,Washington  D.C.,en,,,,,,,,"<div class=""comment"">

We recognize differences between a politician who is ""willful"" and one who is ""willing"" even though the difference does not cross word-stems or parts of speech. We recognize that being ""held up"" evokes different experiences depending upon whether its direct object is a meeting, a bank, or an example. Although we can notice hundreds of examples in the language where small differences in wording produce large reader effects, the authors of The Power of Words argue that these examples are random glimpses of a hidden systematic knowledge that governs how we, as writers or speakers, learn to shape experience for other human beings. Over the past several years, David Kaufer and his colleagues have developed a software program for analyzing writing called DocuScope. This book illustrates the concepts and rhetorical theory behind the software analysis, examining patterns in writing and showing writers how their writing works in different categories to accomplish varying objectives. Reflecting the range and variety of audience experience that contiguous words of surface English can prime, the authors present a theory of language as an instrument of rhetorically priming audiences and a catalog of English strings to implement the theory. The project creates a comprehensive map of the speaker and writer's implicit knowledge about predisposing audience experience at the point of utterance. The book begins with an explanation of why studying language from the standpoint of priming--not just meaning--is vital to non-question begging theories of close reading and to language education in general. The remaining chapters in Part I detail the steps taken to prepare a catalog study of English strings for their properties as priming instruments. Part II describes in detail the catalog of priming categories, including enough examples to help readers see how individual words and strings of English fit into the catalog. The final part describes how the authors have applied the catalog of English strings as priming tools to conduct textual research.",2004,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,,,,,,,,,,,Lawrence Erlbaum Associates,New Jersey & London,en,,,,,,,,"Over the past several years, David Kaufer and his colleagues have developed a software program for analyzing writing (DocuScope).

By collecting contributions on nineteen projects - very diversified for geographic and chronological context, for script and language, and for typology of digital output - this volume intends to point out the methodological issues which are specific to the application of information technologies to epigraphy.
The first part of the volume is focused on data modelling and encoding, which are conditioned by the specific features of different scripts and languages, and deeply influence the possibility to perform searches on texts and the approach to the lexicographic study of such under-resourced languages. The second part of the volume is dedicated to the initiatives aimed at fostering aggregation, dissemination and the reuse of epigraphic materials, and to discuss issues of interoperability.
The common theme of the volume is the relationship between the compliance with the theoretic tools and the methodologies developed by each different tradition of studies, and, on the other side, the necessity of adopting a common framework in order to produce commensurable and shareable results. The final question is whether the computational approach is changing the way epigraphy is studied, to the extent of renovating the discipline on the basis of new, unexplored questions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

KXXU4M9R,book,2009,"Willinsky, John",The Access Principle: The Case for Open Access to Research and Scholarship,,978-0-262-51266-4,,,http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/access-principle,"Questions about access to scholarship go back farther than recent debates over subscription prices, rights, and electronic archives suggest. The great libraries of the past—from the fabled collection at Alexandria to the early public libraries of nineteenth-century America—stood as arguments for increasing access. In The Access Principle, John Willinsky describes the latest chapter in this ongoing story—online open access publishing by scholarly journals—and makes a case for open access as a public good. A commitment to scholarly work, writes Willinsky, carries with it a responsibility to circulate that work as widely as possible: this is the access principle. In the digital age, that responsibility includes exploring new publishing technologies and economic models to improve access to scholarly work. Wide circulation adds value to published work; it is a significant aspect of its claim to be knowledge. The right to know and the right to be known are inextricably mixed. Open access, argues Willinsky, can benefit both a researcher-author working at the best-equipped lab at a leading research university and a teacher struggling to find resources in an impoverished high school. Willinsky describes different types of access—the New England Journal of Medicine, for example, grants open access to issues six months after initial publication, and First Monday forgoes a print edition and makes its contents immediately accessible at no cost. He discusses the contradictions of copyright law, the reading of research, and the economic viability of open access. He also considers broader themes of public access to knowledge, human rights issues, lessons from publishing history, and ""epistemological vanities."" The debate over open access, writes Willinsky, raises crucial questions about the place of scholarly work in a larger world—and about the future of knowledge.",2009,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,,,,,,The Access Principle,,,,,The MIT Press,,en,,,,,,,,"Questions about access to scholarship have always raged. The great libraries of the past stood as arguments for increasing access. John Willinsky describes the latest chapter in this ongoing story - online open access publishing by scholarly journals andmakes a case for open access as a public good.

Computational authorship attribution does not rely on in-depth reading, but rather automates the process. This book investigates the behavior of a text categorization approach to the task when confronted with scalability issues. By addressing the issues of experimental design, data size, and author set size, the dissertation demonstrates whether the approach taken is valid in experiments with limited or sufficient data, and with small or large sets of authors. ""Scalability issues in authorship attribution"" provides the first in-depth and systematic study of the so-called scalability issues in authorship attribution. Above all, the book stresses the importance of methodology: even the smallest of decisions can significantly influence the outcome and reliability of an experiment.",2010,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,,,,,,,,,,,ASA Publishers,Brussel,en,,,,,,,,"Provides an in-depth and systematic study of the so-called scalability issues in authorship attribution -- the task that aims to identify the author of a text, given a model of authorial style based on texts of known authorship.

It discusses the essence of experiments, illustrates how studies are designed, how to develop questionnaires, and helps readers to collect and analyze data by themselves. The book presents qualitative approaches to research but focuses mostly on quantitative methods, detailing the workings of basic statistics. At the end, the book also shows how to give papers at international conferences, how to draft a report, and what is involved in the preparation of a publishable article.",2012,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,,,,,,,,,,,John Benjamins Pub.,"Amsterdam, Netherlands; Philadelphia, PA",en,,,,,,,,"Focuses on the empirical research methods for the Humanities.

There are now hundreds of Digital Humanities centres worldwide and the subject is taught at both postgraduate and undergraduate level. Yet the term ‘Digital Humanities’ is much debated. This reader brings together, for the first time, in one core volume the essential readings that have emerged in Digital Humanities. We provide a historical overview of how the term ‘Humanities Computing’ developed into the term ‘Digital Humanities’, and highlight core readings which explore the meaning, scope, and implementation of the field.

From the archives of ancient Sumeria and the Library of Alexandria to the Library of Congress and Wikipedia, humanity has wrestled with the problem of harnessing its intellectual output. The timeless quest for wisdom has been as much about information storage and retrieval as creative genius.In Cataloging the World, Alex Wright introduces us to a figure who stands out in the long line of thinkers and idealists who devoted themselves to the task. Beginning in the late nineteenth century, Paul Otlet, a librarian by training, worked at expanding the potential of the catalog card, the world's first information chip. From there followed universal libraries and museums, connecting his native Belgium to the world by means of a vast intellectual enterprise that attempted to organize and code everything ever published. Forty years before the first personal computer and fifty years before the first browser, Otlet envisioned a network of ""electric telescopes"" that would allow people everywhere to search through books, newspapers, photographs, and recordings, all linked together in what he termed, in 1934, a réseau mondial--essentially, a worldwide web.Otlet's life achievement was the construction of the Mundaneum--a mechanical collective brain that would house and disseminate everything ever committed to paper. Filled with analog machines such as telegraphs and sorters, the Mundaneum--what some have called a ""Steampunk version of hypertext""--was the embodiment of Otlet's ambitions. It was also short-lived. By the time the Nazis, who were pilfering libraries across Europe to collect information they thought useful, carted away Otlet's collection in 1940, the dream had ended. Broken, Otlet died in 1944.Wright's engaging intellectual history gives Otlet his due, restoring him to his proper place in the long continuum of visionaries and pioneers who have struggled to classify knowledge, from H.G. Wells and Melvil Dewey to Vannevar Bush, Ted Nelson, Tim Berners-Lee, and Steve Jobs.

Whether you're looking for the latest and greatest in XSLT 1.0 techniques, or moving on to XSLT 2.0, this new edition of XSLT will address your needs. This book includes plenty of practical, real-world examples to show you how to apply XSLT stylesheets to XML data using either version.",2008,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,990,,,,,,,,,,O'Reilly Media,"Sebstopol, CA",en,,,,,,,,"XSLT documents a core technology for processing XML. Originally created for page layout, XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Transformations) is now much more: a general-purpose translation tool, a system for reorganizing document content, and a way to generate multiple results-- such as HTML, WAP, and SVG--from the same content. What sets XSLT apart from other books on this critical tool is the depth of detail and breadth of knowledge that Doug Tidwell, a developer with years of XSLT experience, brings to his concise treatment of the many talents of XSLT. He covers XSLT and XPath, a critical companion standard, and addresses topics ranging from basic transformations to complex sorting and linking. He explores extension functions on a variety of different XSLT processors and shows ways to combine multiple documents using XSLT. Code examples add a real-world dimension to each technique. Useful as XSLT is, its peculiar characteristics make it difficult to get started in, and the ability to use advanced techniques depends on a clear and exact understanding of how XSLT templates work and interact. For instance, the understanding of ""variables"" in XSLT is deeply different from the understanding of ""variables"" in procedural languages. The author explains XSLT by building from the basics to its more complex and powerful possibilities, so that whether you're just starting out in XSLT or looking for advanced techniques, you'll find the level of information you need.

It is not a toolkit for Internet research, or operating instructions for a software package; it deals with broader questions. How can we study social media to learn something about society rather than about social media use? How can hyperlinks reveal not just the value of a Web site but the politics of association? Rogers proposes repurposing Web-native techniques for research into cultural change and societal conditions. We can learn to reapply such ""methods of the medium"" as crawling and crowd sourcing, PageRank and similar algorithms, tag clouds and other visualizations; we can learn how they handle hits, likes, tags, date stamps, and other Web-native objects. By ""thinking along"" with devices and the objects they handle, digital research methods can follow the evolving methods of the medium. Rogers uses this new methodological outlook to examine the findings of inquiries into 9/11 search results, the recognition of climate change skeptics by climate-change-related Web sites, the events surrounding the Srebrenica massacre according to Dutch, Serbian, Bosnian, and Croatian Wikipedias, presidential candidates' social media ""friends,"" and the censorship of the Iranian Web. With Digital Methods, Rogers introduces a new vision and method for Internet research and at the same time applies them to the Web's objects of study, from tiny particles (hyperlinks) to large masses (social media).",2013,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,280,,,,,,,,,,MIT Press,"Cambridge, MA",en,,,,,,,,"Get 12 months FREE access to the Digital Methods Manual (an abridged, interactive eBook that provides handy step-by-step guidance to your phone, tablet, laptop or reading device) when purchasing ISBN: 9781526487995 Paperback & Interactive eBook.

This new account is based on an extensive analysis of a quarter-of-a-million word electronic collection of written narrative texts, including both fiction and non-fiction. The book includes detailed discussions of: The construction of this corpus of late twentieth-century written British narratives taken from fiction, newspaper news reports and (auto)biographies The development of a manual annotation system for speech, writing and thought presentation and its application to the corpus. The findings of a quantitive and qualitative analysis of the forms and functions of speech, writing and thought presentation in the three genres represented in the corpus. The findings of the analysis of a range of specific phenomena, including hypothetical speech, writing and thought presentation, embedded speech, writing and thought presentation and ambiguities in speech, writing and thought presentation. Two case studies concentrating on specific texts from the corpus. Corpus Stylistics shows how stylistics, and text/discourse analysis more generally, can benefit from the use of a corpus methodology and the authors' innovative approach results in a more reliable and comprehensive categorisation of the forms of speech, writing and thought presentation than have been suggested so far. This book is essential reading for linguists interested in the areas of stylistics and corpus linguistics.

This is a beginning book, so we will aim to teach you everything you need to know from scratch. This book will be equally beneficial to designers and programmers alike. What's Covered in this Book This book is divided into two parts. The first part introduces XML and XSL T bit by bit, gradually demonstrating the techniques that you need to generate HTML (and other formats) from XML. The second part pulls the theory together by looking at some of the other things that you can do with XSLT, including generating formats other than HTML, pulling information out of a variety of XML formats, and validating XML.

Wo spielt Literatur? Die vermeintlich simple Frage eröffnet ein erst in Ansätzen etabliertes Forschungsgebiet mit neuen methodischen Zugängen unter dem Stichwort »Literaturgeographie«. Jede literarische Handlung ist irgendwo lokalisiert, wobei die Skala von gänzlich imaginären bis zu realistisch gezeichneten Schauplätzen mit hohem Wiedererkennungswert reicht. Die Literaturgeographie rückt die vielfältigen Bezugnahmen von Räumen der Fiktion auf den Realraum hin ins Zentrum der Aufmerksamkeit: Literatur weist eine spezifische Geographie auf, die ganz eigenen Regeln folgt. Denn fiktionale Räume sind niemals nur mimetische Abbilder der Realität, auch wenn sie sich auf existierende Landschaften und Städte beziehen. Vielmehr müssen die poetologischen Verfahren von Verfremdung, Überblendung, Neubenennung, die Kombinationsmöglichkeiten von realen Orten mit fiktiven Elementen in Visualisierungskonzepte und Deutungen der Textanalysen einfließen. Diese Theorie findet zunächst Anwendung auf eine an literarischen Schauplätzen überreiche Modellregion: auf den Vierwaldstättersee und das Gotthardmassiv in der Zentralschweiz. Im Anschluss wird der methodische Horizont für einen Literaturatlas aufgespannt - und das Potenzial literatur­geographischer Konzepte im Hinblick auf eine vergleichende europäische Literaturgeschichte aufgezeigt. 17 beigefügte vierfarbige Faltkarten ermöglichen die differenzierte Gegenüberstellung von fiktionalen und realen Landschaften.",2008,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,,,,,,Die Geographie der Literatur,,,,,Wallstein,Göttingen,de,,,,,,,,"Modellregion Vierwaldstättersee- und Gotthardgegend.

Stephen Ramsay's intriguing study of computational text analysis examines how computers can be used as ""reading machines"" to open up entirely new possibilities for literary critics. Computer-based text analysis has been employed for the past several decades as a way of searching, collating, and indexing texts. Despite this, the digital revolution has not penetrated the core activity of literary studies: interpretive analysis of written texts. Computers can handle vast amounts of data, allowing for the comparison of texts in ways that were previously too overwhelming for individuals, but they may also assist in enhancing the entirely necessary role of subjectivity in critical interpretation. Reading Machines discusses the importance of this new form of text analysis conducted with the assistance of computers.

In tracing historical changes in the processes of composition, revision, production, distribution and reception, Shillingsburg reveals what is involved in the task of transferring texts from print to electronic media. He explores the potentials, some yet untapped, for electronic representations of printed works in ways that will make the electronic representation both more accurate and more rich than was ever possible with printed forms. However, he also keeps in mind the possible loss of the book as a material object and the negative consequences of technology.",2006,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cambridge Univ.
