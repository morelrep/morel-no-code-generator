In recent years, however, the emergence of digital scholarship has revolutionized -- and complicated -- the picture in unexpected ways as new electronic media have enabled academics to communicate scholarly material in innovative formats such as websites, PowerPoint presentations, CD-ROMs, and virtual reality ""tours."" Despite this growing output of sophisticated digital scholarship, there has been little attempt to set standards, define basic issues and concepts, or integrate electronic scholarship into the tenure debate. This collection of cutting-edge articles marks the first effort to evaluate the place of digital scholarship in the tenure, promotion, and review process. As a primer aimed at scholars, faculty members, and department chairs in the humanities, social sciences, and other fields, as well as deans, provosts, and university administrators, this collection examines the evolution of nontraditional scholarship, analyzes the various formats, and suggests guidelines for assessment on a scholarly level. It also examines the impact of digital scholarship in the classroom and academy and explores new directions for the future. This book will help shape policy in the murky world of tenure review and become a point of reference for scholars and administrators everywhere.",2004,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,277,,,,,,,,,,M.E.

Computational authorship attribution does not rely on in-depth reading, but rather automates the process. This book investigates the behavior of a text categorization approach to the task when confronted with scalability issues. By addressing the issues of experimental design, data size, and author set size, the dissertation demonstrates whether the approach taken is valid in experiments with limited or sufficient data, and with small or large sets of authors. ""Scalability issues in authorship attribution"" provides the first in-depth and systematic study of the so-called scalability issues in authorship attribution. Above all, the book stresses the importance of methodology: even the smallest of decisions can significantly influence the outcome and reliability of an experiment.",2010,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,,,,,,,,,,,ASA Publishers,Brussel,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Internet lies at the core of an information infrastructure for distributed, data-intensive, and collaborative research. Although much attention has been paid to the new technologies making this possible, from digitized books to sensor networks, it is the underlying social and policy changes that will have the most lasting effect on the scholarly enterprise. In Scholarship in the Digital Age, Christine Borgman explores the technical, social, legal, and economic aspects of the kind of infrastructure that we should be building for scholarly research in the twenty-first century. Borgman describes the roles that information technology plays at every stage in the life cycle of a research project and contrasts these new capabilities with the relatively stable system of scholarly communication, which remains based on publishing in journals, books, and conference proceedings. No framework for the impending “data deluge” exists comparable to that for publishing. Analyzing scholarly practices in the sciences, social sciences, and humanities, Borgman compares each discipline’s approach to infrastructure issues. In the process, she challenges the many stakeholders in the scholarly infrastructure--scholars, publishers, libraries, funding agencies, and others--to look beyond their own domains to address the interaction of technical, legal, economic, social, political, and disciplinary concerns. Scholarship in the Digital Age will provoke a stimulating conversation among all who depend on a rich and robust scholarly environment. Christine L. Borgman is Professor and Presidential Chair in Information Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles. She is the author of From Gutenberg to the Global Information Infrastructure: Access to Information in the Networked World (MIT Press, 2000).",2010,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,,,,,,Scholarship in the digital age,,,,,MIT Press,Cambridge  Mass. ;;London,en,,,,,,,,,,,,meta_GiveOverview; obj_DigitalHumanities; act_Conceptualizing; obj_Infrastructures; obj_Methods,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What was once understood to be a transcendent virtual reality is now experienced as a ubiquitous grid of data that we move through and interact with every day, raising new questions about the social, locative, embodied, and object-oriented nature of our experience in the networked world.   In The Emergence of the Digital Humanities, Steven E. Jones examines this shift in our relationship to digital technology and the ways that it has affected humanities scholarship and the academy more broadly. Based on the premise that the network is now everywhere rather than merely ""out there,"" Jones links together seemingly disparate cultural events—the essential features of popular social media, the rise of motion-control gaming and mobile platforms, the controversy over the ""gamification"" of everyday life, the spatial turn, fabrication and 3D printing, and electronic publishing—and argues that cultural responses to changes in technology provide an essential context for understanding the emergence of the digital humanities as a new field of study in this millennium.",2013,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,224,,,,,,,,,,Routledge,New York,en,,,,,,,,,,,,meta_GiveOverview; obj_DigitalHumanities; meta_Assessing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Et si le numérique constituait, après l’invention de l’écriture et celle de l’imprimerie, la troisième grande révolution ? A ces questions, Michel Wieviorka en ajoute une autre : l’ère du numérique ne pourrait-elle pas susciter en France aussi le renouveau des sciences humaines et sociales (SHS) ? Sa réponse est oui. Dans ce manifeste, le sociologue met en évidence le retard des SHS françaises dans la prise en compte et l’utilisation des nouveaux outils numériques. Sans doute ceux-ci représentent-ils un risque pour les libertés individuelles. Mais ils sont aussi un formidable outil de travail pour le chercheur en sciences sociales, fertile en innovations, nouvelles pratiques et nouvelles méthodes : le monde virtuel ne pourrait-il pas, par exemple, constituer un nouveau terrain d’enquête ? L’histoire, dont Fukuyama prédisait la fin, ne devient-elle pas une histoire à la fois globale et individuelle grâce aux Big data et leurs millions de données consultables en open access ?

Yet the use of these tools is limited—many historians and history educators have resisted adopting them because they fail to see how digital tools supplement and even improve upon conventional tools (such as books). In Pastplay, a collection of essays by leading history and humanities researchers and teachers, editor Kevin Kee works to address these concerns head-on. How should we use technology? Playfully, Kee contends. Why? Because doing so helps us think about the past in new ways; through the act of creating technologies, our understanding of the past is re-imagined and developed. From the insights of numerous scholars and teachers, Pastplay argues that we should play with technology in history because doing so enables us to see the past in new ways by helping us understand how history is created; honoring the roots of research, teaching, and technology development; requiring us to model our thoughts; and then allowing us to build our own understanding.",2014,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,,,,,,,Digital Culture,,,,Univ. of Michigan Press,Ann Arbor,en,,,,,,,,,,,,meta_Teaching; obj_DigitalHumanities,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DXNV5YUP,book,2010,"Alpaydin, Ethem",Introduction to machine learning,,978-0-262-01243-0,,,http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-machine-learning,"The goal of machine learning is to program computers to use example data or past experience to solve a given problem. Many successful applications of machine learning exist already, including systems that analyze past sales data to predict customer behavior, optimize robot behavior so that a task can be completed using minimum resources, and extract knowledge from bioinformatics data. Introduction to Machine Learning is a comprehensive textbook on the subject, covering a broad array of topics not usually included in introductory machine learning texts. In order to present a unified treatment of machine learning problems and solutions, it discusses many methods from different fields, including statistics, pattern recognition, neural networks, artificial intelligence, signal processing, control, and data mining. All learning algorithms are explained so that the student can easily move from the equations in the book to a computer program. The text covers such topics as supervised learning, Bayesian decision theory, parametric methods, multivariate methods, multilayer perceptrons, local models, hidden Markov models, assessing and comparing classification algorithms, and reinforcement learning. New to the second edition are chapters on kernel machines, graphical models, and Bayesian estimation; expanded coverage of statistical tests in a chapter on design and analysis of machine learning experiments; case studies available on the Web (with downloadable results for instructors); and many additional exercises. All chapters have been revised and updated. Introduction to Machine Learning can be used by advanced undergraduates and graduate students who have completed courses in computer programming, probability, calculus, and linear algebra. It will also be of interest to engineers in the field who are concerned with the application of machine learning methods.",2010,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,537,,,,,,Adaptive computation and machine learning,,,,MIT Press,"Cambridge, Mass",en,,,,,,,,,,,,AnalyzeStatistically; obj_AnyObject; *****,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2nd ed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Katherine Hayles poses this question at the beginning of this bracing exploration of the idea that we think through, with, and alongside media. As the age of print passes and new technologies appear every day, this proposition has become far more complicated, particularly for the traditionally print-based disciplines in the humanities and qualitative social sciences. With a rift growing between digital scholarship and its print-based counterpart, Hayles argues for contemporary technogenesis-the belief that humans and technics are coevolving-and advocates for what she calls comparative media studies, a new approach to locating digital work within print traditions and vice versa. Hayles examines the evolution of the field from the traditional humanities and how the digital humanities are changing academic scholarship, research, teaching, and publication. She goes on to depict the neurological consequences of working in digital media, where skimming and scanning, or ""hyper reading,"" and analysis through machine algorithms are forms of reading as valid as close reading once was. Hayles contends that we must recognize all three types of reading and understand the limitations and possibilities of each. In addition to illustrating what a comparative media perspective entails, Hayles explores the technogenesis spiral in its full complexity. She considers the effects of early databases such as telegraph code books and confronts our changing perceptions of time and space in the digital age, illustrating this through three innovative digital productions-Steve Tomasula's electronic novel, T.O.C.; Steven Hall's The Raw Shark Texts; and Mark Z. Danielewski's Only Revolutions. Deepening our understanding of the extraordinary transformative powers digital technologies have placed in the hands of humanists, How We Think presents a cogent rationale for tackling the challenges facing the humanities today.",2012,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,,,,,,How we think,,,,,The University of Chicago Press,Chicago; London,en,,,,,,,,,,,,meta_GiveOverview; obj_DigitalHumanities; act_Conceptualizing; obj_Methods,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He insists that such a move could bring new luster to a tired field, one that in some respects is among ""the most backwards disciplines in the academy."" Literary study, he argues, has been random and unsystematic. For any given period scholars focus on a select group of a mere few hundred texts: the canon. As a result, they have allowed a narrow distorting slice of history to pass for the total picture.Moretti offers bar charts, maps, and time lines instead, developing the idea of ""distant reading,"" set forth in his path-breaking essay ""Conjectures on World Literature,"" into a full-blown experiment in literary historiography, where the canon disappears into the larger literary system. Charting entire genres'the epistolary, the gothic, and the historical novel'as well as the literary output of countries such as Japan, Italy, Spain, and Nigeria, he shows how literary history looks significantly different from what is commonly supposed and how the concept of aesthetic form can be radically redefined.",2005,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,140,,,,,"Graphs, maps, trees",,,,,Verso,,en,,,,,,,,,,,,obj_Literature; AnalyzeStatistically,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ausgangspunkt der Beiträge ist eine Auffassung von Literaturwissenschaft als Realwissenschaft: Literarische Texte wie auch ihr historisches Bedingungsgefüge, die sogenannten Kontexte, gelten als empirisch beobachtbare Sachverhalte.

HIGPF7BM,book,2010,"Forte, Maurizio",Cyber-Archaeology,,978-1-4073-0721-3,,,,"The ontology of archaeological information, or the cybernetics of archaeology, refers to all the interconnective relationships which the datum produces, the code of transmission, and its transmittability. Because it depends on interrelationships, by its very nature information cannot be neutral with respect to how it is processed and perceived. It follows that the process of knowledge and communication have to be unified and represented by a single vector. 3D information is regarded as the core of the knowledge process, because it creates feedback, then cybernetic difference, among the interactor, the scientist and the ecosystem. It is argued that Virtual Reality (both offline and online) represents a possible ecosystem, which is able to host top-down and bottom-up processes of knowledge and communication. In these terms, the past is generated and coded by “a simulation process”. Thus, from the first phases of data acquisition in the field, the technical methodologies and technologies that we use, influence in a decisive way all the subsequent phases of interpretation and communication. Thus, the questions which we pose in a phase of bottom-up knowledge (for example, in an archaeological excavation) will influence the top-down phases of interpretation, or the mental patterns (for example, a comparative analysis and reconstruction of models). If we peremptorily separate knowledge and communication, we risk losing information along the way, reducing the relationships that are constructed between acquisition/input and transmission/output. At the University of California, Merced, we are experimenting different forms of virtual embodiment and participatory learning. The innovation factor is mainly based on the principle of “enaction”: A principle employed by avatar-driven virtual (embodied) communities for perceiving and constructing information. This neuro-phenomenologic approach is based on the assumption that the cognitive activity is “embodied”, i. e. not separated from the body perception. In these terms it can be correctly identified and communicated only within its specific context. It seems evident that embodiment depends on the level of immersion in the cyberspace: if well implemented embodied communities should be able to learn and transmit more knowledge and in a shorter time than traditional text-based “chatting” communities. We distinguish different types of embodiment (A-B-C) according to levels and modalities of participatory learning and capacities of interaction; each embodiment level will focus on a different kind of interactive learning interface, content target and group of users. Embodiment A: Virtual Participatory Museum. In this case the VR system is planned for interactive platforms (each one with a mono display) and a large HD stereo display serving for group display. The users/players interact in a common 3D space, the rest of the audience can watch by stereo vision. In this way it is possible to obtain a double participation: one active, between the user/players and one passive between a larger audience watching the environment in the large 3D screen. Target users are museum visitors. Embodiment B: Simulation Participatory Environment. (Powerwall, http:// graphics.ucmerced.edu/ research.html). The primary purpose of this environment is to visualize datasets in a large and interactive high resolution display capable of achieving a very high degree of 3D immersion. Within the Powerwall environment it will be possible to integrate full-body 3D motion capture devices in order to implement novel interaction interfaces between immersed users, the environment, and avatars or autonomous characters simulated in the virtual environment. This environment will enable the team to develop new humanlike motion interfaces for collaborative virtual environments, in particular for achieving seamless human-computer interactions accessible to non computer experts for programming motions in the virtual environments. This will allow archeologists to precisely program the correct motions associated with the environment and will enable a novel concept of “Motion Heritage”. Target users are: archaeologists and scientific community.",2010,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,153,,,,,,,,,,Archaeopress,"Oxford, England",en,,,,,,,,,,,,meta_GiveOverview; obj_Artefacts; X-CHECK; obj_AnyObject,,,,"Forte, Maurizio",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Magus was first published in 1966 and was revised and republished by Fowles in 1977.  Fowles' own comment on the second edition was that it was 'rather more than a stylistic revision.' The book explores how the revised version is linguistically different from the original, especially in terms of point of view (re) representation.  The corpus stylistic approach adopted combines qualitative and quantitative comparison to confirm the overall text style difference.  The analysis demonstrates that computer assisted methods can identify significant linguistic features which literary critics have not noticed and provide a more detailed descriptive basis for literary interpretation of (either edition) of the novel.  This analysis of The Magus serves as a case study and exemplar of how corpus techniques may be used generally in the study of linguistics.",2011,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,254,,,,,Corpus stylistics in principles and practice,Advances in stylistics,,,,Continuum,London ; New York,en,,,,,,,,,,,,AnalyzeStatistically; AnalyzeQualitatively,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New technology is changing the very nature of research and teaching in the social sciences and humanities. From specialized online forums to Web-based teaching and distance learning, computers are being used to expand educational opportunities, promote cooperation and collaboration, stimulate creative thinking, and find answers to previously insoluble research problems. Combining interactive projects in a CD-ROM format with informative printed essays, this volume showcases innovations that are revolutionizing the craft of scholarship. More than that, it examines realistically how applicable the new technology is to learning. Contributors clarify some of the difficulties of using computers and address problems with the philosophy and culture of computers, including concerns about intellectual property protection and the potential for creating a technological underclass of electronically disadvantaged schools and universities. The accompanying CD features multimedia entries such as an interactive project on owls that educates users about forest ecology; RiverWeb, an interactive archive of information on the history, culture, and science of the Mississippi River; and ""Global Jukebox,"" which recreates the context in which the folklorist Alan Lomax made his pioneering field recordings.

The present book is the first comprehensive survey of the field from a literary perspective to appear for forty years. It covers both traditional and computer based approaches to attribution, and evaluates each in respect of their potentialities and limitations. It revisits a number of famous controversies, including those concerning the authorship of the Homeric poems, books from the Old and New Testaments, and the plays of Shakespeare.

As budgets shrink and funders of research increasingly demand evidence of value for money and demonstrable benefits for society, there is increasing pressure to provide plans of sustainable management of data. Ensuring that important information remains discoverable, accessible and intelligible and is shared as part of a larger web of data will mean research has a life beyond its initial purpose and can offer real utility to the wider institution and beyond. This edited collection, bringing together leading figures in the field from the UK and around the world, provides an introduction to all the key data issues facing the HE and information management communities. Using the authors' expertise and relevant international case studies, it defines what is required to achieve a culture of effective data management offering practical advice on the skills required, legal and contractual obligations, strategies and management plans and the data management infrastructure of specialists and services. Each chapter covers a critical element of data management including: the meaning of data management; the lifecycle of data management; the policy environment; an organisational approach to achieving digital sustainability; data management plans and planning; roles and responsibilities for libraries and librarians; the challenge to university information services; an analysis of the New World approach; and resources and sources of support to data management. This is essential reading for librarians and information professionals working in the higher education sector, the research community, policy makers and university managers. It will also be a useful introduction for students taking courses in information management, archivists and national library services.",2012,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,,,,,,,,,,,Facet Publishing,London,en,,,,,,,,,,,,goal_Capture; goal_Storage; obj_AnyObject,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is not a toolkit for Internet research, or operating instructions for a software package; it deals with broader questions. How can we study social media to learn something about society rather than about social media use? How can hyperlinks reveal not just the value of a Web site but the politics of association? Rogers proposes repurposing Web-native techniques for research into cultural change and societal conditions. We can learn to reapply such ""methods of the medium"" as crawling and crowd sourcing, PageRank and similar algorithms, tag clouds and other visualizations; we can learn how they handle hits, likes, tags, date stamps, and other Web-native objects. By ""thinking along"" with devices and the objects they handle, digital research methods can follow the evolving methods of the medium. Rogers uses this new methodological outlook to examine the findings of inquiries into 9/11 search results, the recognition of climate change skeptics by climate-change-related Web sites, the events surrounding the Srebrenica massacre according to Dutch, Serbian, Bosnian, and Croatian Wikipedias, presidential candidates' social media ""friends,"" and the censorship of the Iranian Web. With Digital Methods, Rogers introduces a new vision and method for Internet research and at the same time applies them to the Web's objects of study, from tiny particles (hyperlinks) to large masses (social media).",2013,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,280,,,,,,,,,,MIT Press,"Cambridge, MA",en,,,,,,,,,,,,bigdata~,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the widescale adoption of the internet and the rise of the world wide web, the world has been overwhelmed by digital information. Digital data is being produced on a massive scale by individuals and institutions: some of it is born, lives and dies only in digital form, and it is the potential death of this data, with its impact on the preservation of culture, that is the concern of this book. So how can information professionals try to remedy this? Digital preservation is a complex issue involving many different aspects and views, and each chapter of this edited collection is written by an international expert on the topic. Many case studies and examples are used to ground the ideas and theories in real concerns and practice. The book will arm the information professional with the knowledge they need about these important and pressing issues, and give examples of best practice to help find solutions. Its chapters cover: key issues in digital preservation; strategies for digital preservation; the status of preservation metadata in the digital library community; web archiving; the costs of digital preservation; it's money that matters in long-term preservation; European approaches to digital preservation; and, digital preservation projects: case studies. This is an indispensable guide for information managers, librarians and archivists worldwide.

Which paint color is most likely to tell you that a used car is in good shape? How can officials identify the most dangerous New York City manholes before they explode? And how did Google searches predict the spread of the H1N1 flu outbreak? The key to answering these questions, and many more, is big data. “Big data” refers to our burgeoning ability to crunch vast collections of information, analyze it instantly, and draw sometimes profoundly surprising conclusions from it. This emerging science can translate myriad phenomena—from the price of airline tickets to the text of millions of books—into searchable form, and uses our increasing computing power to unearth epiphanies that we never could have seen before. A revolution on par with the Internet or perhaps even the printing press, big data will change the way we think about business, health, politics, education, and innovation in the years to come. It also poses fresh threats, from the inevitable end of privacy as we know it to the prospect of being penalized for things we haven’t even done yet, based on big data’s ability to predict our future behavior. In this brilliantly clear, often surprising work, two leading experts explain what big data is, how it will change our lives, and what we can do to protect ourselves from its hazards.

This year, the world will generate 5 zettabytes of data. (That's a five with twenty-one zeros after it.) Big data is revolutionizing the sciences, transforming the humanities, and renegotiating the boundary between industry and the ivory tower. What is emerging is a new way of understanding our world, our past, and possibly, our future. In Uncharted, Erez Aiden and Jean-Baptiste Michel tell the story of how they tapped into this sea of information to create a new kind of telescope: a tool that, instead of uncovering the motions of distant stars, charts trends in human history across the centuries. By teaming up with Google, they were able to analyze the text of millions of books. The result was a new field of research and a scientific tool, the Google Ngram Viewer, so groundbreaking that its public release made the front page of The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The Boston Globe, and so addictive that Mother Jones called it ""the greatest timewaster in the history of the internet."" Using this scope, Aiden and Michel-and millions of users worldwide-are beginning to see answers to a dizzying array of once intractable questions. How quickly does technology spread? Do we talk less about God today? When did people start ""having sex"" instead of ""making love""? At what age do the most famous people become famous? How fast does grammar change? Which writers had their works most effectively censored by the Nazis? When did the spelling ""donut"" start replacing the venerable ""doughnut""? Can we predict the future of human history? Who is better known-Bill Clinton or the rutabaga? All over the world, new scopes are popping up, using big data to quantify the human experience at the grandest scales possible. Yet dangers lurk in this ocean of 1s and 0s-threats to privacy and the specter of ubiquitous government surveillance.

It then examines how these corpora enhance our understanding of literary and non-literary works. In the first section the author introduces the concepts of concordance and lexical frequency, concepts which are then applied to a range of areas of language study. Key areas examined are the use of on-line corpora to complement traditional stylistic analysis, and the ways in which methods such as concordance and frequency counts can reveal a particular ideology within a text. Presenting an accessible and thorough understanding of the underlying principles of electronic text analysis, the book contains abundant illustrative examples and a glossary with definitions of main concepts.

Wo spielt Literatur? Die vermeintlich simple Frage eröffnet ein erst in Ansätzen etabliertes Forschungsgebiet mit neuen methodischen Zugängen unter dem Stichwort »Literaturgeographie«. Jede literarische Handlung ist irgendwo lokalisiert, wobei die Skala von gänzlich imaginären bis zu realistisch gezeichneten Schauplätzen mit hohem Wiedererkennungswert reicht. Die Literaturgeographie rückt die vielfältigen Bezugnahmen von Räumen der Fiktion auf den Realraum hin ins Zentrum der Aufmerksamkeit: Literatur weist eine spezifische Geographie auf, die ganz eigenen Regeln folgt. Denn fiktionale Räume sind niemals nur mimetische Abbilder der Realität, auch wenn sie sich auf existierende Landschaften und Städte beziehen. Vielmehr müssen die poetologischen Verfahren von Verfremdung, Überblendung, Neubenennung, die Kombinationsmöglichkeiten von realen Orten mit fiktiven Elementen in Visualisierungskonzepte und Deutungen der Textanalysen einfließen. Diese Theorie findet zunächst Anwendung auf eine an literarischen Schauplätzen überreiche Modellregion: auf den Vierwaldstättersee und das Gotthardmassiv in der Zentralschweiz. Im Anschluss wird der methodische Horizont für einen Literaturatlas aufgespannt - und das Potenzial literatur­geographischer Konzepte im Hinblick auf eine vergleichende europäische Literaturgeschichte aufgezeigt. 17 beigefügte vierfarbige Faltkarten ermöglichen die differenzierte Gegenüberstellung von fiktionalen und realen Landschaften.",2008,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,,,,,,Die Geographie der Literatur,,,,,Wallstein,Göttingen,de,,,,,,,,,,,,act_Visualizing; obj_Literature,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In tracing historical changes in the processes of composition, revision, production, distribution and reception, Shillingsburg reveals what is involved in the task of transferring texts from print to electronic media. He explores the potentials, some yet untapped, for electronic representations of printed works in ways that will make the electronic representation both more accurate and more rich than was ever possible with printed forms.

Most records today are born digital, and libraries and other collecting institutions increasingly receive computer storage media as part of their acquisition of ""papers"" from writers, scholars, scientists, musicians, and public figures. This poses new challenges to librarians, archivists, and curators—challenges related to accessing and preserving legacy formats, recovering data, ensuring authenticity, and maintaining trust. The methods and tools developed by forensics experts represent a novel approach to these demands. For example, the same forensics software that indexes a criminal suspect's hard drive allows the archivist to prepare a comprehensive manifest of the electronic files a donor has turned over for accession.

There are already historical studies of musicology, logic, art history, linguistics, and historiography, but this volume gathers these, and many other humanities disciplines, into a single coherent account. Its central theme is the way in which scholars throughout the ages and in virtually all civilizations have sought to identify patterns in texts, art, music, languages, literature, and the past. What rules can we apply if we wish to determine whether a tale about the past is trustworthy? By what criteria are we to distinguish consonant from dissonant musical intervals? What rules jointly describe all possible grammatical sentences in a language? How can modern digital methods enhance pattern-seeking in the humanities? Rens Bod contends that the hallowed opposition between the sciences (mathematical, experimental, dominated by universal laws) and the humanities (allegedly concerned with unique events and hermeneutic methods) is a mistake born of a myopic failure to appreciate the pattern-seeking that lies at the heart of this inquiry. A New History of the Humanities amounts to a persuasive plea to give Panini, Valla, Bopp, and countless other often overlooked intellectual giants their rightful place next to the likes of Galileo, Newton, and Einstein.",2013,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,,,,,,A new history of the humanities,,,,,Oxford Univ.

KMKM4U6Q,book,2013,,Frontiers in Massive Data Analysis,,,,,http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=18374,"Data mining of massive data sets is transforming the way we think about crisis response, marketing, entertainment, cybersecurity and national intelligence. Collections of documents, images, videos, and networks are being thought of not merely as bit strings to be stored, indexed, and retrieved, but as potential sources of discovery and knowledge, requiring sophisticated analysis techniques that go far beyond classical indexing and keyword counting, aiming to find relational and semantic interpretations of the phenomena underlying the data. Frontiers in Massive Data Analysis examines the frontier of analyzing massive amounts of data, whether in a static database or streaming through a system. Data at that scale--terabytes and petabytes--is increasingly common in science (e.g., particle physics, remote sensing, genomics), Internet commerce, business analytics, national security, communications, and elsewhere. The tools that work to infer knowledge from data at smaller scales do not necessarily work, or work well, at such massive scale. New tools, skills, and approaches are necessary, and this report identifies many of them, plus promising research directions to explore. Frontiers in Massive Data Analysis discusses pitfalls in trying to infer knowledge from massive data, and it characterizes seven major classes of computation that are common in the analysis of massive data. Overall, this report illustrates the cross-disciplinary knowledge--from computer science, statistics, machine learning, and application disciplines--that must be brought to bear to make useful inferences from massive data",2013,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2013-09-12 06:49:29,,,,,,,,,,,,The National Academies Press,Washington,en,,,,,,,,,,,,AnalyzeStatistically,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the growing availability and popularity of opinion-rich resources such as online review sites and personal blogs, new opportunities and challenges arise as people now can, and do, actively use information technologies to seek out and understand the opinions of others. The sudden eruption of activity in the area of opinion mining and sentiment analysis, which deals with the computational treatment of opinion, sentiment, and subjectivity in text, has thus occurred at least in part as a direct response to the surge of interest in new systems that deal directly with opinions as a first-class object. This survey covers techniques and approaches that promise to directly enable opinion-oriented information-seeking systems. Our focus is on methods that seek to address the new challenges raised by sentiment-aware applications, as compared to those that are already present in more traditional fact-based analysis. We include materialon summarization of evaluative text and on broader issues regarding privacy, manipulation, and economic impact that the development of opinion-oriented information-access services gives rise to.

The coverage combines breadth and depth, offering necessary background material on such topics as probability, optimization, and linear algebra as well as discussion of recent developments in the field, including conditional random fields, L1 regularization, and deep learning. The book is written in an informal, accessible style, complete with pseudo-code for the most important algorithms. All topics are copiously illustrated with color images and worked examples drawn from such application domains as biology, text processing, computer vision, and robotics.

Since that time, scholars' definitions of literature and their rationales for teaching it have changed radically. But the periodized structure of the curriculum has remained oddly unshaken, as if the exercise of contrasting one literary period with another has an importance that transcends the content of any individual course. Why Literary Periods Mattered explains how historical contrast became central to literary study, and why it remained institutionally central in spite of critical controversy about literature itself. Organizing literary history around contrast rather than causal continuity helped literature departments separate themselves from departments of history. But critics' long reliance on a rhetoric of contrasted movements and fateful turns has produced important blind spots in the discipline. In the twenty-first century, Underwood argues, literary study may need digital technology in particular to develop new methods of reasoning about gradual, continuous change.",2013,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,,,,,,Why literary periods mattered,,,,,Stanford University Press,Standford,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As well as showcasing this method, the case studies in ‘Reading by Numbers’ provide a revised history of the Australian novel, focusing on the nineteenth century and the decades since the end of the Second World War, and engaging with a range of themes including literary and cultural value, authorship, gender, genre and the transnational circulation of fiction. The book’s findings challenge established arguments in Australian literary studies, book history, feminism and gender studies, while presenting innovative ways of understanding literature, publishing, authorship and reading, and the relationships between them.

Yet what exactly style is and how it works are elusive: We certainly know it when we see it, but there is no shared and clear understanding of the diverse phenomena that we call style. The Structure of Style explores this issue from a computational viewpoint, in terms of how information is represented, organized, and transformed in the production and perception of different styles. New computational techniques are now making it possible to model the role of style in the creation of and response to human artifacts—and therefore to develop software systems that directly make use of style in useful ways. Argamon, Burns, and Dubnov organize the research they have collected in this book according to the three roles that computation can play in stylistics. The first section of the book, Production, provides conceptual foundations by describing computer systems that create artifacts—musical pieces, texts, artworks—in different styles. The second section, Perception, explains methods for analyzing different styles and gleaning useful information, viewing style as a form of communication. The final section, Interaction, deals with reciprocal interaction between style producers and perceivers, in areas such as interactive media, improvised musical accompaniment, and game playing. The Structure of Style is written for researchers and practitioners in areas including information retrieval, computer art and music, digital humanities, computational linguistics, and artificial intelligence, who can all benefit from this comprehensive overview and in-depth description of current research in this active interdisciplinary field.",2010,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,,,,,,The structure of style,,,,,Springer,Heidelberg; New York,en,,,,,,,,,,,,t_Stylometry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We take advantage of this revolutionary opportunity when we make our work “open access”: digital, online, free of charge, and free of most copyright and licensing restrictions. Open access is made possible by the Internet and copyright-holder consent, and many authors, musicians, filmmakers, and other creators who depend on royalties are understandably unwilling to give their consent. But for 350 years, scholars have written peer-reviewed journal articles for impact, not for money, and are free to consent to open access without losing revenue. In this concise introduction, Peter Suber tells us what open access is and isn’t, how it benefits authors and readers of research, how we pay for it, how it avoids copyright problems, how it has moved from the periphery to the mainstream, and what its future may hold.

Using a downloadable programming environment developed by the author, Visualizing Data demonstrates methods for representing data accurately on the Web and elsewhere, complete with user interaction, animation, and more. How do the 3.1 billion A, C, G and T letters of the human genome compare to those of a chimp or a mouse? What do the paths that millions of visitors take through a web site look like? With Visualizing Data, you learn how to answer complex questions like these with thoroughly interactive displays. We're not talking about cookie-cutter charts and graphs. This book teaches you how to design entire interfaces around large, complex data sets with the help of a powerful new design and prototyping tool called ""Processing"". Used by many researchers and companies to convey specific data in a clear and understandable manner, the Processing beta is available free. With this tool and Visualizing Data as a guide, you'll learn basic visualization principles, how to choose the right kind of display for your purposes, and how to provide interactive features that will bring users to your site over and over. This book teaches you: The seven stages of visualizing data -- acquire, parse, filter, mine, represent, refine, and interactHow all data problems begin with a question and end with a narrative construct that provides a clear answer without extraneous detailsSeveral example projects with the code to make them workPositive and negative points of each representation discussed. The focus is on customization so that each one best suits what you want to convey about your data set The book does not provide ready-made ""visualizations"" that can be plugged into any data set. Instead, with chapters divided by types of data rather than types of display, you'll learn how each visualization conveys the unique properties of the data it represents -- why the data was collected, what's interesting about it, and what stories it can tell.

We recognize differences between a politician who is ""willful"" and one who is ""willing"" even though the difference does not cross word-stems or parts of speech. We recognize that being ""held up"" evokes different experiences depending upon whether its direct object is a meeting, a bank, or an example. Although we can notice hundreds of examples in the language where small differences in wording produce large reader effects, the authors of The Power of Words argue that these examples are random glimpses of a hidden systematic knowledge that governs how we, as writers or speakers, learn to shape experience for other human beings. Over the past several years, David Kaufer and his colleagues have developed a software program for analyzing writing called DocuScope. This book illustrates the concepts and rhetorical theory behind the software analysis, examining patterns in writing and showing writers how their writing works in different categories to accomplish varying objectives. Reflecting the range and variety of audience experience that contiguous words of surface English can prime, the authors present a theory of language as an instrument of rhetorically priming audiences and a catalog of English strings to implement the theory. The project creates a comprehensive map of the speaker and writer's implicit knowledge about predisposing audience experience at the point of utterance. The book begins with an explanation of why studying language from the standpoint of priming--not just meaning--is vital to non-question begging theories of close reading and to language education in general. The remaining chapters in Part I detail the steps taken to prepare a catalog study of English strings for their properties as priming instruments. Part II describes in detail the catalog of priming categories, including enough examples to help readers see how individual words and strings of English fit into the catalog. The final part describes how the authors have applied the catalog of English strings as priming tools to conduct textual research.",2004,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,,,,,,,,,,,Lawrence Erlbaum Associates,New Jersey & London,en,,,,,,,,,,,,act_Visualizing; AnalyzeStatistically; AnalyzeQualitatively,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It can advance a story, illuminate its role in our daily lives, and help us understand how events unfold. In this groundbreaking interdisciplinary work, Inderjeet Mani uses recent developments in linguistics and computer science to analyze the use of time in narrative form.   The Imagined Moment outlines directions for an emerging discipline of “corpus narratology,” an approach involving the computer analysis and interpretation of multimillion-word collections of narrative text. This approach, Mani explains, could alter the very foundations of narrative theory. Accordingly, he develops a computer representation for timelines and applies it to a variety of literary works. Among these are such classics as One Hundred Years of Solitude, “A Hunger Artist,” Swann’s Way, Jealousy, Candide, and “The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber.” Along the way, Mani considers stories embedded in temporal cycles; the cognitive processes involved in the construal of events in time; the modeling of narrative progression in terms of changes in readers’ evaluation of characters; the study of variations of tempo in fiction; and time in computer-mediated forms of storytelling.",2010,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,,,,,,The imagined moment,,,,,University of Nebraska Press,Lincoln,en,,,,,,,,,,,,AnalyzeStatistically,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The spread of digital technology across philology, linguistics and literary studies suggests that text scholarship is taking on a more laboratory-like image. The ability to sort, quantify, reproduce and report text through computation would seem to facilitate the exploration of text as another type of quantitative scientific data. However, developing this potential also highlights text analysis and text interpretation as two increasingly separated sub-tasks in the study of texts. The implied dual nature of interpretation as the traditional, valued mode of scholarly text comparison, combined with an increasingly widespread reliance on digital text analysis as scientific mode of inquiry raises the question as to whether the reflexive concepts that are central to interpretation – individualism, subjectivity – are affected by the anonymised, normative assumptions implied by formal categorisations of text as digital data.",2010,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,296,,,,,Text comparison and digital creativity,Scholarly communication,v. 1,,,Brill,Leiden ; Boston,,,,,,,,,,,,,goal_Enrichment; t_Encoding; obj_Manuscripts,"Peursen, W.

Style and Substance in the Age of Information,,,,,http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/E/bo3680280.html,"If economics is about the allocation of resources, then what is the most precious resource in our new information economy? Certainly not information, for we are drowning in it. No, what we are short of is the attention to make sense of that information.  With all the verve and erudition that have established his earlier books as classics, Richard A. Lanham here traces our epochal move from an economy of things and objects to an economy of attention. According to Lanham, the central commodity in our new age of information is not stuff but style, for style is what competes for our attention amidst the din and deluge of new media. In such a world, intellectual property will become more central to the economy than real property, while the arts and letters will grow to be more crucial than engineering, the physical sciences, and indeed economics as conventionally practiced. For Lanham, the arts and letters are the disciplines that study how human attention is allocated and how cultural capital is created and traded. In an economy of attention, style and substance change places. The new attention economy, therefore, will anoint a new set of moguls in the business world—not the CEOs or fund managers of yesteryear, but new masters of attention with a grounding in the humanities and liberal arts.  Lanham’s The Electronic Word was one of the earliest and most influential books on new electronic culture.

This important book brings together leading textual critics, scholarly editors, technical specialists and publishers to discuss whether and how existing paradigms for developing and using critical editions are changing to reflect the increased commitment to and assumed significance of digital tools and methodologies.",2009,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,205,,,,,,Digital research in the arts and humanities,,,,Ashgate,"Farnham, England ; Burlington, VT",en,,,,,,,,,,,,goal_Enrichment; t_Encoding,"Deegan, Marilyn; Sutherland, Kathryn",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CGWEYU4S,book,2013,"Manovich, Lev",Software takes command,,978-1-62356-745-3 978-1-62356-817-7,,,http://manovich.net/index.php/projects/software-takes-command,"Software has replaced a diverse array of physical, mechanical, and electronic technologies used before 21st century to create, store, distribute and interact with cultural artifacts. It has become our interface to the world, to others, to our memory and our imagination - a universal language through which the world speaks, and a universal engine on which the world runs. What electricity and combustion engine were to the early 20th century, software is to the early 21st century. Offering the the first theoretical and historical account of software for media authoring and its effects on the practice and the very concept of 'media,' the author of The Language of New Media (2001) develops his own theory for this rapidly-growing, always-changing field. What was the thinking and motivations of people who in the 1960 and 1970s created concepts and practical techniques that underlie contemporary media software such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Maya, Final Cut and After Effects? How do their interfaces and tools shape the visual aesthetics of contemporary media and design? What happens to the idea of a 'medium' after previously media-specific tools have been simulated and extended in software? Is it still meaningful to talk about different mediums at all? Lev Manovich answers these questions and supports his theoretical arguments by detailed analysis of key media applications such as Photoshop and After Effects, popular web services such as Google Earth, and the projects in motion graphics, interactive environments, graphic design and architecture. Software Takes Command is a must for all practicing designers and media artists and scholars concerned with contemporary media.",2013,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,,,,,,,,,,,Bloomsbury,New York,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Making use of corpus- and computerlinguistic methods and statistical procedures, the study shows that intuitive stylistic findings can in many cases be corroborated by empirical data. Ideally, the intuitive and the empirical approaches to style should be understood as complementing each other rather than as mutually exclusive concepts. The notion of style that emerges from this study is that of a number of basic decisions made by the author of a text, from which the remaining discriminatory linguistic characteristics of that text, choices, are derived.",1999,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,426,,352,,,,Europäische Hochschulschriften,14,,,Lang,Frankfurt am Main [u.a.],en,,,,,,,"Augsburg, Univ., Diss., 1998",,,,,act_StylisticAnalysis; AnalyzeStatistically; t_Stylometry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gries,,978-3-11-020564-0,,,http://www.degruyter.com/view/product/203826,"his book is the revised and extended second edition of Statistics for Linguistics with R. The volume is an introduction to statistics for linguists using the open source software R. It is aimed at students and instructors/professors with little or no statistical background and is written in a non-technical and reader-friendly/accessible style. It first introduces in detail the overall logic underlying quantitative studies: exploration, hypothesis formulation and operationalization, and the notion and meaning of significance tests. It then introduces some basics of the software R relevant to statistical data analysis. A chapter on descriptive statistics explains how summary statistics for frequencies, averages, and correlations are generated with R and how they are graphically represented best. A chapter on analytical statistics explains how statistical tests are performed in R on the basis of many different linguistic case studies: For nearly every single example, it is explained what the structure of the test looks like, how hypotheses are formulated, explored, and tested for statistical significance, how the results are graphically represented, and how one would summarize them in a paper/article. A chapter on selected multifactorial methods introduces how more complex research designs can be studied: methods for the study of multifactorial frequency data, correlations, tests for means, and binary response data are discussed and exemplified step-by-step. Also, the exploratory approach of hierarchical cluster analysis is illustrated in detail. The book comes with many exercises, boxes with short think breaks and warnings, recommendations for further study, and answer keys as well as a statistics for linguists newsgroup on the companion website. Just like the first edition, it is aimed at students, faculty, and researchers with little or no statistical background in statistics or the open source programming language R. It avoids mathematical jargon and discusses the logic and structure of quantitative studies and introduces descriptive statistics as well as a range of monofactorial statistical tests for frequencies, distributions, means, dispersions, and correlations. The comprehensive revision includes new small sections on programming topics that facilitate statistical analysis, the addition of a variety of statistical functions readers can apply to their own data, a revision of overview sections on statistical tests and regression modeling, a complete rewrite of the chapter on multifactorial approaches, which now contains sections on linear regression, binary and ordinal logistic regression, multinomial and Poisson regression, and repeated-measures ANOVA, and a new visual tool to identify the right statistical test for a given problem and data set. The amount of code available from the companion website has doubled in size, providing much supplementary material on statistical tests and advanced plotting.",2009,2025-11-07 11:50:12,2025-11-07 11:50:12,,,,,,,,Statistics for linguistics with R,,,,,Mouton de Gruyter,Berlin,en,,,,,,,,,,,,AnalyzeStatistically; obj_Language,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
